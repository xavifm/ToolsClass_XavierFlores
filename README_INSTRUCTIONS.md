Exercise 1 Implementation

To run Exercise 1, follow these steps:

    Project Setup:
        Open the project in your editor. Upon loading, a popup message should appear stating:
        "Asset Dependency Log exported correctly!"

    Log Outputs:
        The logs are saved in the Saved\Logs directory.
        Logs are named following the format: RefLogOutput_YYMMDD (where YYMMDD corresponds to the current date).

    Implementation Details:
        The core functionality is implemented in the Delivery1UtilityObject.cpp class.
        The initialization logic is executed through the Delivery1Blueprint blueprint, which runs automatically when the editor starts.

Ensure everything is working as expected by verifying the popup message and checking the log files for proper output.
